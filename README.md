##Interesting points
This article is interesting to me because it explains the nuances behind deepseek's success, and how the human race can leverage open source technology as a mean of AI advancement. It discusses how China's move to open source technology, despite being isolated from U.S.'s advanced chip technology, chose a bold route. However, firms like Cisco have also found critical security concerns, like Deepseek succumbing to all harmful prompts that they set up. Ethical concerns are also brought up, like data breaches are also a concern.
