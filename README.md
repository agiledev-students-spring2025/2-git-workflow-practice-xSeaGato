[Deepseek Breakthrough](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/deepseek-breakthrough-emboldens-open-source-ai-models-like-meta-llama.html)

## Interesting points
This article is interesting to me because it explains the nuances behind deepseek's success, and how the human race can leverage open source technology as a mean of AI advancement. It discusses how China's move to open source technology, despite being isolated from U.S.'s advanced chip technology, chose a bold route. However, firms like Cisco have also found critical security concerns, like Deepseek succumbing to all harmful prompts that they set up. Ethical concerns are also brought up, like data breaches are also a concern.

I thought the article was very interesting and it did a good job at pointing out the importance of having open source applications and the disadvantages that comes with it. Of course I have heard about Deepseek, but I was never too interested to read into it. Now that I have read this article, I think it is fascinating that there is a starting to be a solution to the amount of energy that AI consumes.
